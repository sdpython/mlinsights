    I had to implement a custom criterion to optimize
    a decision tree and I wanted to leverage :epkg:`scikit-learn`
    instead of rewriting my own. Version 0.21 of :epkg:`scikit-learn`
    introduced some changed in the API which make possible
    to overload an existing criterion and replace some of the logic
    by another one: `_criterion.pyx
    <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/tree/_criterion.pyx>`_.
    The purpose was to show that a fast implementation requires
    some tricks (see :ref:`piecewiselinearregressioncriterionrst`) and
    `piecewise_tree_regression_criterion.pyx
    <https://github.com/sdpython/mlinsights/blob/master/src/mlinsights/mlmodel/piecewise_tree_regression_criterion.pyx>`_,
    `piecewise_tree_regression_criterion_fast.pyx
    <https://github.com/sdpython/mlinsights/blob/master/src/mlinsights/mlmodel/piecewise_tree_regression_criterion_fast.pyx>`_
    for the code. Other than that, every function to overlaod is marked as
    :epkg:`nogil`. Every function or method marked as *nogil* cannot
    go through the :epkg:`GIL` (see also :epkg:`PEP-0311`),
    which no :epkg:`python` object can be created in that method.
    In fact, no :epkg:`python` can be called inside a :epkg:`Cython`
    method protected with *nogil*. The issue with that is that
    any :epkg:`numpy` method cannot be called.

    My goal was to replace the implemention of the decision tree
    criterion by something optimizing a linear regression, basically
    something close to function :epkg:`numpy:linalg:lstsq` but that's
    inside :epkg:`numpy` so unavailable in a *nogil* method.
    I needed to use the inner API from :epkg:`BLAS` or :epkg:`LAPACK`
    and available in :epkg:`cython` through
    `cython_blas <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/linalg.cython_blas.html>`_
    (matrix operations)
    `cython_lapack <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/linalg.cython_lapack.html>`_
    (complex matrix operations).
    It is fast but not really well documented...
    I needed to use function `dgelss
    <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d9/d4e/dgelss_8f.html>`_
    (same from scipy `scipy.linalg.lapack.dgelss
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lapack.dgelss.html>`_).
    which documentation is available through :epkg:`Lapack documentation`.
    Its signature can be found at `cython_lapack_signatures.txt
    <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/linalg/cython_lapack_signatures.txt>`_
    and is the following:

    ::

        cdef void dgelss(int *m, int *n, int *nrhs, double *a, int *lda, double *b, int *ldb,
                         double *s, double *rcond, int *rank,
                         double *work, int *lwork, int *info) nogil

    I tried and it failed many times before getting it correctly.
    Most of the time, :epkg:`python` just crashes without telling me
    what the issue is. I had to use many ``printf`` in the :epkg:`cython`
    code to get it right (remember no python call, so no *print* function).
    These function do not do any allocation, every needed buffer
    must be allocated first. The documentation gives some recommendations
    about the optimal buffer size. The function usually modifies the inputs,
    they must be copied first if the user wants to reuse them later.
    I finally implemented :func:`dgelss <mlinsights.mlmodel.direct_blas_lapack.dgless>` or
    on github: `direct_blas_lapack.pyx
    <https://github.com/sdpython/mlinsights/blob/master/src/mlinsights/mlmodel/direct_blas_lapack.pyx>`_.
