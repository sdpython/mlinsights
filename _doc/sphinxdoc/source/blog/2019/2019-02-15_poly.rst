    The current implementation of
    `PolynomialFeatures
    <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html>`_
    in *scikit-learn* computes each new feature
    independently and that increases the number of
    data exchanged between *numpy* and *Python*.
    The idea of the implementation in
    :class:`ExtendedFeatures <mlinsights.mldmodel.extended_features.ExtendedFeatures>`
    is to reduce this number by brodcast multiplications.
    The second optimization occurs by transposing the matrix:
    dense matrix are organized by rows in memory so
    it is faster to mulitply two rows than two columns.
    See :ref:`fasterpolynomialfeaturesrst`.
