    :epkg:`scikit-learn` introduced nice feature to
    be able to process mixed type column in a single
    pipeline which follows :epkg:`scikit-learn` API:
    `ColumnTransformer <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
    modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html>`_
    `FeatureUnion <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/
    generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html>`_ and
    `Pipeline <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/
    generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html>`_. Ideas are not
    new but it is finally taking place in
    :epkg:`scikit-learn`.

    As *a picture says a thousand words*, I tried to
    do something similar to what I did for
    `nimbusml <https://github.com/Microsoft/NimbusML>`_
    to draw a :epkg:`scikit-learn` pipeline.
    I ended it up implemented function
    :ref:`pipeline2dot <mlinsights.plotting.visualize.pipeline2dot>`
    which converts a pipeline into :epkg:`DOT` language
    as :epkg:`scikit-learn` does for a decision tree with
    `export_graphviz <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
    modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html>`_.
    I created the notebook :ref:`visualizepipelinerst`.
