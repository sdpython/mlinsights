    I decided to turn one of the notebook I wrote about
    `Piecewise Linear Regression <https://sdpython.github.io/doc/dev/mlstatpy/regression_lineaire.html#regression-lineaire-par-morceaux>`_.
    I wanted to turn my code into something usable and following
    the *scikit-learn* API:
    :class:`PiecewiseRegression <mlinsights.mlmodel.piecewise_estimator.PiecewiseRegression>`
    and another notebook :ref:`piecewiselinearregressionrst`.
