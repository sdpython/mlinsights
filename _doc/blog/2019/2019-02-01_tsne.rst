    :epkg:`t-SNE` is quite an interesting tool to
    visualize data on a map but it has one drawback:
    results are not reproducible. It is much more powerful
    than a :epkg:`PCA` but the results is difficult to
    interpret. Based on some experiment, if :epkg:`t-SNE`
    manages to separate classes, there is a good chance that
    a classifier can get good performances. Anyhow, I implemented
    a regressor which approximates the :epkg:`t-SNE` outputs
    so that it can be used as features for a further classifier.
    I create a notebook :ref:`predictabletsnerst` and a new tranform
    :class:`PredictableTSNE <mlinsights.sklapi.predictable_tsne.PredictableTSNE>`.
