    The unit test are run against
    :epkg:`scikit-learn` 0.23, 0.24.
    Some unit tests are failing with version 0.23.
    They were disabled instead of looking into a cause
    which does not appear with the latest version.
    It affects all classes inheriting from :class:`SkBase
    <mlinsights.sklapi.sklearn_base.SkBase>` where a model
    using it is trained. The issue happens in :epkg:`joblib`.
